# Docker Pipelines

Pipelines is a docker image specialized to execute docker CI/CD tasks. Some similar tools are:

- [Habitus](https://github.com/cloud66/habitus)
- [Gitlab Runner](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/README.html#gitlab-ci-yml)
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/configure-bitbucket-pipelines-yml-792298910.html)

The key idea behind __Docker Pipelines__ is to be optimzed for docker and easy of use. The only dependency to execute a pipeline is to have docker installed.
